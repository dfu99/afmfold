High-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) enables direct visualization of protein dynamics under near-physiological conditions, yet its intrinsic limitation to surface topography prevents atomic-level structural characterization. We present AFM-Fold, a generative AI-based framework that reconstructs three-dimensional protein conformations directly from AFM images. AFM-Fold combines a rotation-equivariant convolutional neural network, which extracts low-dimensional collective variables (CVs) from AFM images, with a guided diffusion process that generates conformations consistent with the inferred CVs.
Using pseudo-AFM images of adenylate kinase, AFM-Fold accurately reproduced not only the open and closed conformations, but also intermediate states. Application to 159 experimental HS-AFM frames of the flagellar protein \flhac further demonstrated that AFM-Fold outperforms rigid-body fitting and captures time-correlated domain motions that reflect underlying conformational dynamics.
Importantly, AFM-Fold reconstructs physically plausible structures within approximately one minute per frame without requiring molecular dynamics simulations, making it suitable for high-throughput analysis of HS-AFM movies. By enabling rapid structural interpretation of AFM data, AFM-Fold provides a means to link real-time molecular imaging to underlying conformational landscapes, thereby expanding the biological insight that can be extracted from HS-AFM experiments.
