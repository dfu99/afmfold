\Model provides a new and accessible approach for inferring atomic structures from AFM images, allowing users without specialized computational expertise to obtain results within a short time. 
Unlike methods that rely on computational simulations, it estimates a range of conformations—--including large-scale conformational changes and intermediate states—--from single AFM images.
AFM experiment does not require large experimental facilities or demanding preparation steps such as crystallization, and it uniquely enables the study of molecular dynamics under near-native conditions. 
By extending AFM analysis from qualitative visualization to quantitative structural interpretation, this work enables low-cost and convenient access to structural insights from long-timescale molecular dynamics.
